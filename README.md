We introduce JIND-Multi, an extended version of the JIND framework designed for label transfer across datasets using multiple labeled datasets. When applied to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data, 
JIND-Multi demonstrates a significant reduction in the proportion of unclassified cells while preserving accuracy and performance equivalent to JIND. Notably, our model achieves robust and accurate results 
in its inaugural application to scATAC-Seq data, showcasing its effectiveness in this context.
