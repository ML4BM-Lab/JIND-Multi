**JIND-Multi** is an advanced extension of the JIND framework, designed to automate the annotation of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). This framework, originally introduced by [Goyal et al., 2022](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/9/2488/6543609), now supports the transfer of cell-type labels from multiple annotated datasets, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of annotations. Additionally, **JIND-Multi** is applicable for annotating scATAC-Seq data and can flag cells as "unassigned" if predictions fall below predefined thresholds.

Leveraging multiple annotated datasets, such as those in an atlas, **JIND-Multi** improves the precision of unlabeled dataset annotations while reducing rejection rates (unassigned cells). We offer a robust and efficient implementation of **JIND-Multi**, available for the scientific community.

## Prerequisites for Running Locally

- **Operating System:** Linux or macOS
- **Environment Manager:** [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.6.8 or higher
- **Hardware:** A CPU is sufficient, but using an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA and cuDNN is recommended for better performance.


## üìÅ Required Inputs & Configuration Options

To run JIND-Multi, whether you're training from scratch or using pre-trained models, you need to provide a `.h5ad` file containing your single-cell data and define a few key parameters. Below is a list of required and optional arguments, their types, and what they represent.

| Argument                   | Type     | Required | Description |
|---------------------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PATH`                    | `string` | ‚úÖ       | Path to the input `.h5ad` file. This file must contain your annotated single-cell dataset (AnnData object). |
| `BATCH_COL`               | `string` | ‚úÖ       | Name of the column in `adata.obs` that contains batch or donor identifiers. |
| `LABELS_COL`              | `string` | ‚úÖ       | Name of the column in `adata.obs` that contains cell type labels. |
| `TARGET_DATASET_NAME`     | `string` | ‚úÖ       | Name of the target batch (from `BATCH_COL`) to which the cell type annotations will be transferred. |
| `SOURCE_DATASET_NAME`     | `string` | ‚ùå       | (Optional) Name of the source batch used for training. If not specified, JIND-Multi will automatically select the best source batch based on rejection rate. |
| `OUTPUT_PATH`             | `string` | ‚úÖ       | Path to the directory where output results (metrics, predictions, etc.) will be saved. |
| `PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH`   | `string` | ‚ùå       | (Optional) Path to a directory with pre-trained `.pt` model files and a `.json` with thresholds. If provided, the model will skip training and proceed directly to inference. |
| `INTER_DATASETS_NAMES`    | `string` | ‚ùå       | (Optional) Comma-separated list of intermediate batch names (from `BATCH_COL`) used in multi-step training. Do **not** include the source batch. |
| `EXCLUDE_DATASETS_NAMES`  | `string` | ‚ùå       | (Optional) Comma-separated list of dataset names to exclude from training. Avoid duplicating entries used in `SOURCE`, `TARGET`, or `INTER`. |
| `NUM_FEATURES`            | `int`    | ‚ùå       | (Optional) Number of genes to include in the model. Default: `5000`. |
| `MIN_CELL_TYPE_POPULATION`| `int`    | ‚ùå       | (Optional) Minimum number of cells per cell type per batch required for training. Default: `100`. |
| `USE_GPU`                 | `bool`   | ‚ùå       | (Optional, but recommended) Set to `True` to train using GPU. Default: `True`. |

### üìå Notes

- If `PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH` is provided, JIND-Multi skips training and uses the given models for inference on the target batch.
- If `SOURCE_DATASET_NAME` is not specified, the method automatically selects the source batch that minimizes cell rejection when predicting on the target batch.

## üì§ Output Files and Results Overview

After running JIND-Multi, all outputs are stored in the specified `OUTPUT_PATH` directory. These results include both prediction files and detailed performance metrics for model evaluation.

### üß™ Prediction Results

- **`predicted_label_test_data.xlsx`**  
  This Excel file contains prediction results for each cell in the **target batch**. For each cell, it includes:
  - Probabilities assigned by the model for each cell type.
  - `raw_predictions`: The cell type with the highest probability (before applying thresholds).
  - `predictions`: The final predicted label after applying cell type-specific thresholds (low-confidence predictions may be marked as _Unknown_).

- **Trained Model Files**  
  - Trained models for each annotated batch are saved in `.pt` format inside the `trained_models/` directory.
  - A separate `target.pth` file contains the model trained on the target batch after fine-tuning.
  - The file `val_stats_trained_model.json` contains the predictions on the validation set used to calculate threshold values per cell type.

### üìä Performance Metrics and Confusion Matrices

- JIND-Multi evaluates and records the classification performance at every key step:
  - **Source batch**: Confusion matrices before and after fine-tuning.
  - **Intermediate batches**: Performance at three stages:
    - `initial`: Before alignment.
    - `adapt`: After alignment to the source batch.
    - `finetuned`: After final fine-tuning of encoder and classifier.
  - **Target batch** (if labels are available): Confusion matrices showing:
    - Before alignment.
    - After adaptation.
    - After classifier fine-tuning using confident predictions.

- The matrices display:
  - Number of cells per cell type.
  - How many were predicted as _Unknown_.
  - Accuracy before (raw) and after (effective) thresholding.
  - Misclassified cells.
  - Mean Average Precision (mAP) per cell type.

- **Training history summary**  
  A PDF file named `train[SOURCE_BATCH, INTER_COUNT]-test[TARGET_BATCH].pdf` is also generated. It includes a visual history of confusion matrices across training stages, making it easier to interpret performance changes through each step of the pipeline.
